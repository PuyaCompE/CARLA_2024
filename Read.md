Human-Aware Automotive Testbed with CARLA Driving Simulator

Overview

This project aims to advance human-in-the-loop experimentation by developing a custom-built automotive testbed that integrates physical and virtual simulation environments. Leveraging the CARLA open-source driving simulator, this platform enables comprehensive analysis of driver behavior and interaction under varied scenarios, contributing to the design of safer and more intuitive vehicular systems.

Features

Hardware Components

Racing Seat & Motion Platform: Provides realistic feedback and immersive driving experience.

Steering Wheel & Pedals: Simulates real-world vehicle controls.

Triple-Monitor Setup & VR Headset: Offers high-fidelity visual simulation for enhanced situational awareness.

PC Station: Runs the CARLA driving simulator and handles data collection and analysis.

Biometric Data Collection

To enhance data accuracy and insights, the system integrates:

Zephyr BioHarness 3 Biometric Belt: Captures physiological metrics such as heart rate and respiration.

Wearable GSR Sensor: Monitors galvanic skin response, providing insights into emotional and stress states.

Goals

Driver Behavior Analysis: Understand how humans interact with autonomous systems in varying conditions.

Physiological Insights: Use biometric data to assess stress levels, decision-making, and comfort.

Improved System Design: Inform the development of safer, more intuitive automotive systems based on human factors research.
